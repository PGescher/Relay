Ohh maybe i make the Active Workout.

Of Any module be part of the App Shell? And then just add some Button to minimize it?
And it move to the Bottom or Top until i expand it again? Maybe add a swipe to the side/ Left or right and then the active Pill is a Button on the side that i can then click to reopen the workout?
